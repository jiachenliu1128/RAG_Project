The Seller must also use the most current version of the ARM Note and ARM rider.

The most current version of the Uniform Instruments is the version in effect as of the Note Date of the Mortgage.

For certain ARM products, State-specific versions of the ARM Note have been prepared for Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
